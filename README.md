**Thanks for downloading and checking out my clothing pack!**


This is a project I slapped together with the help of [DurtyFree's](https://github.com/DurtyFree) [Durty Cloth Tool](https://github.com/DurtyFree/durty-cloth-tool)

---------------------------------------

# Disclaimer ⚠️

This clothing pack was tested on gamebuild mpchristmas3 aka 2802 using the popular script, vMenu, with the understanding that there are *about* 14 additional free .ymt slots to be used on this particular gamebuild.

This pack currently uses 4 YMT's; male, female, and pedalternatevariations which is responsible for things such as hiding or removing hair for hats, making high heels work correctly and making sure that heist bags etc are visible on add-on clothing many other things. In my case, I have used it to squash **default gta online** hairstyles when hoodies are worn up.

Custom hairs lack this option due to the bones missing. Most custom hairs are just static props for your head anyways 🤷‍♂️

 
If for whatever reason you crash using this pack, please read here and perhaps consider downgrading your gamebuild until Rockstar Games increases the [YMT limits](https://tinyurl.com/499ad2zn) on/for future DLCs.


See my FiveM tutorial regarding [gamebuilds:](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-tuners-future-dlcs/4784977)

# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

## Single Player 

- Copy the taysbusinesspack folder found within the FILES > SINGLE PLAYER folder  with the dlc.rpf file to this sub folder of your mods folder: mods/update/x64/dlcpacks (Create it if its not there)

- In order to make the game load this new dlc.rpf file, we need to modify the games dlclist.xml, this can be done by searching for dlclist.xml using OpenIV and copying it to your mods folder: mods/update/update.rpf/common/data (Create it if its not there)

- Open the dlclist.xml and add the following:

```xml
<Item>dlcpacks:/taysbusinesspack/</Item>

--------------------------------------

## ALTV

Open the FILES folder, go to ALTV and add taysbusinesspack to your server.cfg as a separate line below resources and before the enclosing. Your server.cfg resources configuration could look similar to this:

```cfg
resources: [
  altv-better-clothing,
  taysbusinesspack
]
```


Start your server and connect to it

--------------------------------------

## FiveM

- Download the updated vMenu and put it in your server/resources folder [vMenu](https://github.com/ProjectFairnessLabs/PF-vMenu/releases)

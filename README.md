**Thanks for downloading and checking out my clothing pack!**


This is a project I slapped together with the help of [DurtyFree's](https://github.com/DurtyFree) [Durty Cloth Tool](https://github.com/DurtyFree/durty-cloth-tool)

---------------------------------------

# Disclaimer ⚠️

This clothing pack was tested on gamebuild mpchristmas3 aka 2802 using the popular script, vMenu, with the understanding that there are *about* 14 additional free .ymt slots to be used

This pack currently uses 4 YMT's; male, female, and pedalternatevariations which is responsible for things such as hiding or removing hair for hats, making high heels work correctly and making sure that heist bags etc are visible on add-on clothing many other things. In my case, I have used it to squash **default gta online** hairstyles when hoodies are worn up.

Custom hairs lack this option due to the bones missing. Most custom hairs are just static props for your head anyways 🤷‍♂️

 
If for whatever reason you crash using this pack, please read here and perhaps consider downgrading your gamebuild until Rockstar Games increases the [YMT limits](https://tinyurl.com/499ad2zn) on/for future DLCs.


See my tutorial regarding [gamebuilds:](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-tuners-future-dlcs/4784977)

### The clothing is based off of New Zealand comedy channel by the name of [Viva La Dirt League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRZHpjCKK8A) and Canadian artist [Crash Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5NEOwRXa_8).

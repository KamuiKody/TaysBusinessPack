Single Player

Copy the taysbusinesspack folder found within the FILES > SINGLE PLAYER folder with the dlc.rpf file to this sub folder of your mods folder: mods/update/x64/dlcpacks (Create it if its not there)

In order to make the game load this new dlc.rpf file, we need to modify the games dlclist.xml, this can be done by searching for dlclist.xml using OpenIV and copying it to your mods folder: mods/update/update.rpf/common/data (Create it if its not there)

Open the dlclist.xml and add the following:

dlcpacks:/taysbusinesspack/

RageMP

I do not use RageMP and have no interest in it. You will have to figure this out yourself.
